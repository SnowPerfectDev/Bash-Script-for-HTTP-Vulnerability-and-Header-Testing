---
<details open>
  <summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>
This bash script is designed to assess the security of web servers by testing for potential vulnerabilities and potential bypasses of security measures. It performs a series of HTTP method tests, including GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, TRACE, TRACK, CONNECT, and PATCH, against a specified URL. Additionally, the script checks the server's response to various custom headers, such as Referer, X-Custom-IP-Authorization, X-Original-URL, and more. The test results are displayed, indicating whether the server responded with successful, redirect, or error HTTP codes. This script serves as a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals and system administrators aiming to evaluate their web servers' resilience against possible attacks.
